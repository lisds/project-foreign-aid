# Notebook A


In this notebook, we begin with some exploratory analysis, first looking at general trends observed across all donor organisations, before later exploring more granular data on the African Development Bank (AfDB) and doing correlation testing. 

Most of our initial cleaning has been included in the 'fetch_data' and 'opening_zip_cleaning' files. 

In fetch_data, we unzip and get the CSV file and set up a dataset with just the first 33 columns (columns A-AG). We've done this for simplicity and ease of analysis as these columns include data across all donor organisations, and these were the primary columns that we were to perform the initial analysis on. Column 33 onwards mostly includes data for specific donor organisations, with several missing values. This sub-dataset later proved to be slightly limiting when we had to refer to or use values from other columns included further along the dataset, e.g. impact ratings and project size, meaning that we had to use the larger dataset (df) to perform this analysis, especially as different team members were interested in different columns -- although this didn't prove to be a major issue. 

In opening_zip_cleaning, we've cleaned donor names by creating DataFrames for unique donors. Having this list of dataset names to hand has been integral to our later work, since this saves us manually filtering for specific donors. 


Below, we're importing the relevant packages and running data:

```{python}
import pandas as pd
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import networkx as nx
import plotly.graph_objects as go
```

```{python}
run fetch_data.py
```

```{python}
run opening_zip_cleaning.py
```

The dataset includes the following donor organisations: <br>
<br>
AfricanDB: African Development Bank <br>
AsianDB: Asian Development Bank <br>
CDB: Caribbean Development Bank <br>
DFAT: Australia’s Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade <br>
DFID: UK’s Department for InternationalDevelopment <br>
GEF: Global Environment Fund <br>
GFATM: Global Fund for AIDS, Tuberculosis, and Malaria <br>
GiZ: German Society for International Cooperation <br>
IFAD: International Fund for Agricultural Development <br>
JICA: Japanese International Cooperation Agency <br> 
KfW: German Development Bank <br>
WB: World Bank <br>
<br>
Within our analysis, we focus mostly on World Bank, AfricanD, GiZ and JICA, in addition to looking at general trends and cumulative values across all organisations.


## Exploratory analysis

```{python}
all_aid
```

Below, we've done some exploratory analysis on donors, mostly just using .describe(). This is because we were interested in general trends and spread of our key numerical values for specific donors e.g. project duration, project size, and overall rating. This helped us identify areas for further exploration, for example looking into why eval_lag values could be negative. This led us to explore completion dates further which we'll elaborate on later in the analysis. 

```{python}
AfricanDB_df
```

```{python}
AfricanDB_df.describe()
```

```{python}
AsianDB_df.describe()
```

```{python}
CDB_df.describe()
```

Eval_lag is the difference between the date of project evaluation and the date of project completion. Interesting to note how the mean eval_lag is negative, suggesting that most projects were evaluated before being completed which is rather odd. <br> However, after some further investigation, we found out that some projects, especially particularly well-funded large-scale projects, generally tend to continue until well after their stipulated completion date, which is why they can continue after being officially evaluated.

```{python}
DFAT_df.describe()
```

Even more negative mean eval_lag value for DFID, showing how most projects on average were evaluated 2272 days before the completion date. **Average wasn't 2272 that was the min value the mean was 154**

```{python}
DFID_df.describe()
```

```{python}
GEF_df.describe()
```

```{python}
WB_df
```

```{python}
all_aid.columns
```

```{python}
num_columns = df.shape[1]
num_columns
```

Identifying the negative eval_lag values prompted us to explore the trend in completion dates further. We first converted them to datetime values to make analysis easier, and by plotting them, we discovered an unusually high number of projects in 1965. Since we couldn't find anything conclusive in the pdf document or online, we hypothesised that this was because all historic projects completed prior to 1965 were also counted as being completed in 1965. Another proposition was that 1965 was the default value, so most of these values were a data entry error. This proved to be important later in the analysis since we had to make the call of whether to exclude these values entirely as they were skewing the results of our regression analysis. 

```{python}
# Grouping by completion year and performing some exploratory analysis

# Convert 'completion_date' to datetime format
all_aid['completion_date'] = pd.to_datetime(all_aid['completion_date'], errors='coerce')

# Create a new column for the completion year
all_aid['completion_year'] = all_aid['completion_date'].dt.year

# Group by completion year
grouped_by_year_completion = all_aid.groupby('completion_year')

# Count the number of projects in each year
projects_count_by_year_completion = grouped_by_year_completion.size()
projects_count_by_year_completion

```

```{python}
# plt.figure(figsize=(10, 6))
projects_count_by_year_completion.plot(kind='bar', color='skyblue')
plt.title('Number of Projects by Completion Year')
plt.xlabel('Completion Year')
plt.ylabel('Number of Projects')
plt.show()
```

Doing the same for start years:

```{python}
# Convert 'start_date' to datetime format
all_aid['start_date'] = pd.to_datetime(all_aid['start_date'], errors='coerce')

# Create a new column for the start year
all_aid['start_year'] = all_aid['start_date'].dt.year

# Group by start year
grouped_by_year_start = all_aid.groupby('start_year')

# Count the number of projects in each year
projects_count_by_year_start = grouped_by_year_start.size()
projects_count_by_year_start
```

```{python}
all_aid['start_year']
```

```{python}
projects_count_by_year_start.plot(kind='bar', color='skyblue')
plt.title('Number of Projects by Start Year')
plt.xlabel('Start Year')
plt.ylabel('Number of Projects')
n = 5
plt.xticks(range(0, len(projects_count_by_year_start.index), n), projects_count_by_year_start.index[::n], rotation=45)
plt.show()   
```

The bar chart above summarises the trend in start years, showing that the number of projects rapidly increased up until the early 2000s after which they started decreasing, perhaps due to a link between 9/11 and aid inflow. However, the number of projects has continued to decrease in recent years, which is slightly counterintuitive. There are a few projects with start years post 2060, which raised some confusion and we've deemed them to be data entry errors post some further investigation. This is because most of the completion years of these projects seem to be pre 2000s and it's unrealistic for start dates to be decided so far ahead in advance.

**When I had looked at this before I was ill I had come to the conclusion that the errors of having projects starting in the long distant future (2060 and beyond) was a result of datetime assuming the wrong century (2070 instead of 1970)**


```{python}
start_after_2000 = all_aid[all_aid['start_year'] > 2000]

grouped_by_year_start_2000 = start_after_2000.groupby('start_year')

# Count the number of projects in each year
projects_count_by_year_start_2000 = grouped_by_year_start_2000.size()

projects_count_by_year_start_2000.plot(kind='bar', color='skyblue')
plt.title('Number of Projects by Start Year')
plt.xlabel('Start Year')
plt.ylabel('Number of Projects')
plt.show()
```

```{python}
start_after_2060 = all_aid[all_aid['start_year'] > 2060]
start_after_2060
```

This analysis seems to contradict our previous analysis of completion years (where we created our own column based on completion date, whereas this is included within the dataset) as the trend observed here is different to what was observed previously. This could either be due to data inconsistencies within the data set or a data manipulation error on our end. 

**Not sure what theyre trying to say here but, the dataset does provide two columns startyear and completionyear that have some of the years already completed. For start year it seamms that the original column (startyear) provides a better result as it doesn't have these long distance future projects. However for completionyear it seems that it has only done it for a minority of the projects and therfore the results shown in the new created column may be more useful, however the issue of a large number of 1965 completiond ates still persists**

```{python}
all_aid.groupby('startyear').size().plot(kind='bar', color='skyblue')
plt.title('Number of Projects by Start Year')
plt.xlabel('Start Year')
plt.ylabel('Number of Projects')
plt.xticks(range(0, len(all_aid.groupby('startyear').size().index), n), all_aid.groupby('startyear').size().index[::n], rotation=45)
plt.show()   
```

```{python}
all_aid['completionyear'].value_counts()
```

```{python}
# Grouping by completionyear
completion_year_test = all_aid.groupby('completionyear')

# Count the number of projects in each year
completion_year_size = completion_year_test.size()
completion_year_size

completion_year_size.plot(kind='bar', color='skyblue')
```

```{python}
all_aid[['completion_year', 'completionyear']]
```

## Country-specific trends over time


Following our analysis on start years, we created the following function to make it easier to illustrate the trend in the number of projects per country. The function can be configured to show start year or completion year for the top 5 (or however many) countries of your choosing.

```{python}
def x_time_plot(df, x_col, y_col, n):
    """
    Group the DataFrame by x_col, count occurrences of values in y_col, 
    select the top n most common values, and plot the results in a line graph.

    Parameters:
    - df: pandas DataFrame
    - x_col: str, the name of the column to use as the x-axis i.e. startyear / completionyear
    - y_col: str, the name of the column to count values in i.e. countryname_WB or countryname_COW
    - n: int, the number of top values to select and plot

    Returns:
    - None (plots the results)
    """
    # Get the top n most common values in y_col
    y_top = df[y_col].value_counts().head(n).index

    # Filter rows where y_col is in the top values
    new_data = df[df[y_col].isin(y_top)]

    # Group by x_col and y_col, count occurrences, and unstack to prepare for plotting
    grouped_data = new_data.groupby([x_col, y_col]).size().unstack()

    # Plot the results
    ax = grouped_data.plot(kind='line', figsize=(10, 6))
    ax.set_xlabel(x_col)
    ax.set_ylabel('Count')
    ax.set_title(f'Top {n} Values in {y_col} Grouped by {x_col}')
    ax.legend(title=y_col, bbox_to_anchor=(1, 1))
    plt.show()

x_time_plot(all_aid, 'startyear', 'countryname_WB', 10)
```

```{python}
new_data_function = df[df['countryname_WB'] == 'Pakistan']
new_data_function
```

This function is a modification of the previous function and plots the number of projects per country. This proved to be very useful for our subsequent more granular analysis per country, helping explain country-specific trends, e.g. those observed in China. 

```{python}
def x_time_plot_country(df, x_col, y_col, country_name):
    """
    Group the DataFrame by x_col, count occurrences of values in y_col for a specific country,
    and plot the results in a line graph.

    Parameters:
    - df: pandas DataFrame
    - x_col: str, the name of the column to use as the x-axis
    - y_col: str, the name of the column to count values in
    - country_name: str, the specific country for which to plot occurrences

    Returns:
    - None (plots the results)
    """
    # Filter rows for the specific country
    new_data_function = df[df[y_col] == country_name]

    # Group by x_col and y_col, count occurrences, and unstack to prepare for plotting
    grouped_data_function = new_data_function.groupby([x_col, y_col]).size().unstack()

    # Plot the results
    ax = grouped_data_function.plot(kind='line', figsize=(10, 6))
    ax.set_xlabel(x_col)
    ax.set_ylabel('Count')
    ax.set_title(f'Number of projects in {country_name}')
    ax.legend(title=y_col, bbox_to_anchor=(1, 1))
    plt.show()

# Example usage:
x_time_plot_country(all_aid, 'startyear', 'countryname_COW', 'China')

```

In the case of China, as above, it received a significant amount of funding (in terms of the number of projects) until 1995, after which the amount of funding slowly started declining, as China became self-sustaining. Generally, according to the OECD, during the 1970s and 1980s, Communist countries in Asia - particularly China and Vietnam - started to receive large amounts of aid. <br> China is an excellent example of how well-directed aid can consequently boost the country's economic development. However, it is difficult to establish causality because of the various extrinsic factors at play. 

```{python}
x_time_plot_country(all_aid, 'startyear', 'countryname_COW', 'Indonesia')
```

```{python}
x_time_plot_country(all_aid, 'startyear', 'countryname_WB', 'Africa')
```

```{python}
x_time_plot_country(all_aid, 'startyear', 'countryname_COW', 'Tanzania')
```

```{python}
x_time_plot_country(all_aid, 'startyear', 'countryname_COW', 'Morocco')
```

```{python}
x_time_plot_country(all_aid, 'startyear', 'countryname_COW', 'India')
```

```{python}
x_time_plot_country(all_aid, 'startyear', 'countryname_COW', 'Mexico')
```

```{python}
all_aid['donor'].value_counts(dropna = False)
```

As suggested in the Codebook PDF under 'suggested variables for further analysis', we created a column for 'Project size in USD'. This was generated by multiplying the appropriate exchange rate as outlined in the Codebook. This helped in ensuring uniformity and consistency when comparing project sizes, especially in our later regression analysis. The exchange rates used are based on current exchange rates at time of first conversion but a better approach would've been using historic exchange rates at time of project approval, or completion. Due to time limitations and for simplicity, we chose to proceed with the values included in the Codebook. 

```{python}
# Function to create project_size_USD_calculated column

project_size_df = all_aid.dropna(subset=['projectsize_original']).copy()

def convert_to_usd(row):
    donor = row['donor']
    amount = row['projectsize_original']
    rates = {'AfricanDB': 1, 'AsianDB': 1_000_000, 'DFID': 1.35, 'GEF': 1_000_000, 'GFATM': 1, 'GiZ': 1_200,
             'IFAD': 1_000_000, 'JICA': 10_687, 'KfW': 1.2, 'WB': 1}
    return rates[donor] * amount


# Apply the modified function to create a new column
project_size_df['project_size_USD_calculated'] = project_size_df.apply(convert_to_usd, axis=1)
```

```{python}
import seaborn as sns
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

sns.set(style="whitegrid")
plt.figure(figsize=(12, 8))

# Create a boxplot 
sns.boxplot(x='donor', y='project_size_USD_calculated', data=project_size_df)

plt.title('Project Size Distribution by Donor')
plt.xlabel('Donor')
plt.ylabel('Project Size (USD)')
plt.show()

```

# Anomalies


The "Project Size Distribution by Donor" graph revealed notable outliers, particularly in the scale of projects managed by the World Bank (WB). To understand the nature and implications of these anomalies, we zoomed in on projects exceeding $10 billion. We conducted a detailed investigation of these large-scale initiatives, combining quantitative data analysis with qualitative research. This allowed us to trace the flow of these substantial investments and comprehend their broader impact. The combined approach helped us identify the specific sectors and regions these projects targeted and evaluate their alignment with strategic development goals and policy priorities.

```{python}
WB_big_spenders = project_size_df[project_size_df['project_size_USD_calculated'] > 10000000000]

WB_big_spenders
```

In our analysis of the PPD data, we focused on projects with a size exceeding 10 billion USD and found four such projects. 


Next we looked at these more granularly and found there was some uncertainty from some of the values. For China's Guizhou-Guangzhou Railway Project, we found evidence that the stated project funds did match up with it actual project funds (Xinhua News (2008), this was also true of the Secondary Education Program project in India (World Bank, 2012), for the other two, there is less evidence, particularly for Mexico's MX Social Protection in Health and SSA III (World Bank, 2014). This is worth further investigation and clarification. The granular investigations for each project are shown below. 

```{python}
#The Mexico project was $26bil!
row_index = 17082
Mexico_project = WB_big_spenders.loc[row_index]
Mexico_project
```

```{python}
 # The first India project was 5 years long (2012-2017) and cost $12billion. 
row_index = 15539
India_1_project = WB_big_spenders.loc[row_index]
India_1_project
```

```{python}
#The second India project cost $29bil (almost $30bil), took place between 2014 and 2018.It was for an unspecified education initiative labeled 'SSA III'
row_index = 15542
India_2_project = WB_big_spenders.loc[row_index]
India_2_project
```

```{python}
#$12bil from the world bank to China over 2009-2016 for the CN-Guizhou-Guangzhou Railway
row_index = 12903
China_project = WB_big_spenders.loc[row_index]
China_project
```

```{python}
x = project_size_df[['donor', 'projectsize_original', 'project_size_USD_calculated']].copy()
plt.hist(x['project_size_USD_calculated'])
```

```{python}
x.groupby('donor').mean()
```

```{python}
x.groupby('donor').std()
```

# Focusing specifically on Africa..


As mentioned in the Literature Review, we were particularly interested in African countries, with some of our exploratory questions geared specifically towards Africa. Therefore, we began with some exploratory analysis to identify the countries where the African Development Bank is investing most heavily. This included plotting the project duration of projects funded by AfDB, and then exploring any outliers that were of interest. 

```{python}
africa_duration = (df['project_duration'] >= 100) & (df['project_duration'] <= 7500) & (df['donor'] == 'AfricanDB')

df_selected_africa = df[africa_duration]

# Plotting the histogram for the selected range
df_selected_africa['project_duration'].plot(kind='hist', bins=20)
```

```{python}
# Zooming in on African outliers i.e. projects with an unusually long duration

africa_duration_outliers = (df['project_duration'] >= 5000) & (df['donor'] == 'AfricanDB')
africa_duration_outliers

df_selected_africa_outliers = df[africa_duration_outliers]
df_selected_africa_outliers
```

We then investigated these outliers further to identify the potential reasons behind their extended duration. <br>
The First Health Rehabilitation Project (FHRP) in Tanzania, for example, was a large-scale healthcare project, the first of its kind in Tanzania, which meant that it continued for around 10 years.

```{python}
df_selected_africa_outliers['projectname']
```

```{python}
# # Trying to create DAGs/Sankey diagram 

# G = nx.DiGraph()

# # Add edges (donor to recipient) based on aid data
# edges = all_aid[['donor', 'countryname_COW']].dropna().values
# G.add_edges_from(edges)

# # Set node positions 
# pos = nx.spring_layout(G)


# plt.figure(figsize=(12, 8))
# nx.draw(G, pos, with_labels=True, node_size=1000, node_color='skyblue', font_size=8, font_color='black', font_weight='bold', edge_color='gray', linewidths=0.5, arrowsize=10)
# plt.title('Aid Inflow Diagram')
# plt.show()
```

This is a generic graph showing the major aid recipients of the African DB. We wanted the arrows to proportionally represent the amount of aid flowing into specific countries, which is why we then created a Sankey diagram. 

```{python}
# Create a directed graph
G = nx.DiGraph()

# Add edges (donor to recipient) based on aid data
edges = AfricanDB_df[['donor', 'countryname_COW']].dropna().values
G.add_edges_from(edges)

# Set node positions
pos = nx.spring_layout(G)

plt.figure(figsize=(12, 8))
nx.draw(G, pos, with_labels=True, node_size=1000, node_color='skyblue', font_size=8, font_color='black', font_weight='bold', edge_color='gray', linewidths=0.5, arrowsize=10)
plt.title('Aid Inflow Diagram')
plt.show()
```

```{python}
# Removing Multinational from countryname_COW
# total_aid_per_country.remove()
i = AfricanDB_df[((AfricanDB_df.countryname_COW != 'Multinational'))]
i

# AfricanDB_df.drop(i)
```

In order to validate that our amounts in the Sankey diagram were accurate, we initially created a simple bar chart to show the aid flowing into African countries (from AfDB).

```{python}
# Bar chart showing the total aid per country in Africa 

total_aid_per_country = i.groupby('countryname_COW')['afdb_projectamount_usd'].sum()


total_aid_per_country = total_aid_per_country[total_aid_per_country > 0].sort_values(ascending=False).head(30)
total_aid_per_country

total_aid_per_country.plot(kind='bar', color='skyblue')
plt.title('Total Aid per Country')
plt.xlabel('Country')
plt.ylabel('Total Aid Amount (USD)')
plt.show()
```

## Sankey Diagrams


As expected, these Sankey diagrams show the inflow of aid into the respective recipient countries. Morocco seemed to disproportionately receive higher funding than other countries, which we later explored further in our analysis.

```{python}
# # This shows aid for all countries funded by the African DB and takes a while to run

# # Calculate the total project amount received by each country
# total_amount_per_country = df.groupby('countryname_COW')['afdb_projectamount_usd'].sum()

# # Create a Sankey diagram
# fig = go.Figure(data=[go.Sankey(
#     node=dict(
#         pad=15,
#         thickness=20,
#         line=dict(color='black', width=0.5),

#         value=df['afdb_projectamount_usd']
#     )
# )])
