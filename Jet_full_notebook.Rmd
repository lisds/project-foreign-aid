```

## Office presence


Here we will dive deeper into understanding the relationship between the aid project rating and whether or not there was an office of the donor entity in the country where the project took place

The rationale behind looking at this aspect of the data is that we believe there is potential for a bias towards higher ratings if the donor has a presence in the country in which the project was active. These projects feed in to the overall reputation and credibility of the donors, and since it is the donor themself who rates the project, it is possible that we would see higher ratings out of six where offices were present.

```{python}
#This code explores the relationship between rating out of 6 and office presence

#this makes a new column where the office presence is turned into an integer; 0 for no, 1 for yes
all_aid['Office?'] = all_aid['office_presence'].apply(lambda x: 'no' if x == 0 else 'yes')

#this rounds the floats of rating to 2 decimal places
all_aid['six_overall_rating'] = pd.to_numeric(all_aid['six_overall_rating'], errors='coerce')
all_aid['Rating Rounded'] = all_aid['six_overall_rating'].round(2)

#makes an array for office presence
office_presence = np.array(all_aid['Office?'])
office_presence

#makesan array for rating
rating = np.array(all_aid['Rating Rounded'])
rating

#This makes a scatter for office presence

def plot_office():
    plt.scatter(office_presence, rating)
    plt.scatter(['no', 'yes'], [0, 1], alpha = 0)
    plt.xlabel('Office?')
    plt.ylabel('Rating')
    
plot_office();
```

```{python}
#this code adds the mean to each group

no_mean = all_aid[all_aid['Office?'] == 'no']['Rating Rounded'].mean()
yes_mean = all_aid[all_aid['Office?'] == 'yes']['Rating Rounded'].mean()

plot_office()
plt.scatter(['no', 'yes'], [no_mean, yes_mean],
            color = 'red', label = 'mean of each group', marker = 'X')
plt.plot(['no', 'yes'], [no_mean,yes_mean],
         color = 'red')
plt.legend();
```

Disappointingly, there is not a very large difference in the mean of the two categories. This does not warrant much further analysis as both categories, despite differing amounts of data points, seem to have a similar average rating.

```{python}
#attempt to run classification test


import pandas as pd

from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from sklearn.linear_model import LogisticRegression
from sklearn.metrics import classification_report, confusion_matrix

# Drop rows where either 'six_overall_rating' or 'donor' is NaN
all_aid_cleaned = all_aid.dropna(subset=['six_overall_rating', 'office_presence'])

# Prepare the data
X = all_aid_cleaned[['six_overall_rating']]  # Predictor
y = all_aid_cleaned['office_presence']  # Target variable

# Split the data into training and testing sets
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y)

# Create and train the logistic regression model
model = LogisticRegression()
model.fit(X_train, y_train)

# Make predictions on the test set
y_pred = model.predict(X_test)

# Model evaluation
classification_report_output = classification_report(y_test, y_pred)

# Generating the confusion matrix
cm = confusion_matrix(y_test, y_pred)

print(classification_report_output)

```

Unfortunately, the prediction model is not accurate. Only 78% accuracy, but due to the disparity in number of data points for each category - far fewer 'no' than 'yes'- this value is likely skewed. The model is learning to always interpret a value as a 'yes' simply because there are many more of that category in the entire data set.

```{python}
#Creates a subset of the dataframe to look at purposes
all_purposes = all_aid[['project_id','donor','six_overall_rating',
                'countryname_COW', 'country_code_WB', 
                'aiddata_purposecode', 'aiddata_purposename']]

#Remove projects with no value in 'aiddata_purposecode'
purposes_notna_series = np.array(all_purposes['aiddata_purposecode'].notna())
df_purposes_notna = all_purposes[purposes_notna_series]
#Create a new dataframe where the index is the purpose and the values are the number of projects
nr_projects_by_purpose = pd.DataFrame({'Purpose':df_purposes_notna['aiddata_purposename'].value_counts().index, 'Number of Projects':df_purposes_notna['aiddata_purposename'].value_counts().values})
nr_projects_by_purpose.set_index('Purpose').head(20)
```

Here we have created a function that examines a specific country's aid projects by sector. This is valuable to know because various countries have disparate growth areas which aid projects target. Revealing which sectors are most invested in by the donors can give insight into both a country's long-term growth strategy and also where donors perceive is the most pressing sector to invest in. In the case of Russia, for example, general environmental protection is the leading sector for investment. This is contrasted by other countries in different locations such as Uganda, which has its own unique set of needs. As Uganda is less developed socially and infrastructurally, their priorties are government and transportation sectors.

```{python}
#Creates a sub dataframe to look at sectors
all_sectors = all_aid[['project_id','donor','six_overall_rating',
                'countryname_COW', 'country_code_WB', 'original_sector', 
                'sector_description','pseudo_sector']]

## Russia 


The graph delineates the distribution of development projects across various sectors in Russia. The sectors of 'General Environment Protection' and 'Government & Civil Society' are the most prominent, indicating a significant focus on environmental initiatives and the strengthening of governmental structures and societal institutions. Conversely, sectors like 'Agriculture' and 'Trade Policies & Regulations' register the fewest projects, suggesting these areas are currently less prioritized within the scope of development strategies or possibly that they are relatively well-established and require less external developmental assistance. The graph reflects strategic decisions on where to allocate resources and efforts to drive development in Russia.

This is interesting as the data pre-dates the conflict in Ukraine, and therefore highlights a trend towards investment in this sector (Barabashev and Klimenko, 2023). 


## Morocco

```{python}
projects_by_sector_graph('Morocco', all_sectors)
```

The analysis of the graph for Morocco's development projects by sector reveals a prioritized focus on agriculture and water supply and sanitation. This prioritization is corroborated by recent financing initiatives, including a US //180 million loan from the World Bank (2022a) to bolster resilient and sustainable agriculture, addressing the dual pressures of climate change and population growth on Morocco's land and water resources​​. Further supporting the water sector, the World Bank has also approved a substantial US $350 million program to assist Morocco in implementing its National Program for Potable Water Supply and Irrigation, part of a long-term National Water Plan​. 

Additionally, in response to escalating drought conditions, Morocco has initiated an emergency program, allocating approximately €940 million for water supply projects, reflecting the government's commitment to improving water access amid environmental challenges (World Bank, 2022b). The African Development Bank (AfDB) has also recognized the critical need for water security in Morocco, approving a $79 million USD financing package aimed at enhancing water production and treatment facilities throughout the country (Magoum, 2022). 

These substantial investments and initiatives in the agriculture and water sectors underscore the graph's indication that these areas are of high priority. They also reflect a strategic alignment with Morocco's developmental and environmental sustainability goals, suggesting a concerted effort to address the essential needs of the population while contending with the broader challenges posed by natural resource scarcity. This is similar to Mexico and India, but very different to Russia. This also validates our function, and the data in the PPD database, as it shows investment is inline with qualitative research on the country and its investments. 



## India

```{python}
projects_by_sector_graph('India', all_sectors)
```

The graph depicting the distribution of development projects by sector in India shows a predominant focus on Agriculture, which aligns with the sector's significant contribution to the nation's GDP and its substantial employment footprint. This focus is essential as agriculture is a central pillar of the Indian economy, employing 60 percent of the nation's workforce and contributing about 17 percent of its GDP, but it faces challenges in productivity, poverty, and malnutrition in rural areas (Dubashi et al., 2023). 

The notable emphasis on Energy and Transport & Storage in the graph could be reflective of India’s infrastructure development initiatives, which are crucial for supporting its expanding economy and augmenting agricultural productivity. Meanwhile, the investment in the Industry sector, which appears to have a moderate number of projects, may signify efforts to diversify the economy and reduce the overdependence on agriculture.

The graph depicting India's sectoral allocation of development projects reveals a curious insight into the country's education sector. Despite being a cornerstone for long-term socio-economic progress, the education sector seems to underrepresent in terms of the number of projects. This observation becomes particularly intriguing when contrasted with the anomalies identified in the dataset—two mammoth-sized projects in the education sector, valued at an astounding \\$12 billion and \\$29 billion, respectively (see Anomalies section). 

Such enormous investments are indicative of significant economic interventions. This discrepancy between the number of projects and the scale of investment might suggest a focus on quality over quantity, with fewer but more substantial, high-impact initiatives designed to create systemic change. It also raises questions about the distribution and efficacy of these high-value projects and whether they align with countries broader goals.


## Mexico

```{python}
projects_by_sector_graph('Mexico', all_sectors)
```

The bar graph provides a detailed breakdown of the number of development projects by sector in Mexico. Agriculture leads significantly, indicating a strong emphasis on developing this traditional cornerstone of the Mexican economy. Meanwhile, sectors related to infrastructure, such as 'Transport & Storage', and 'Water Supply & Sanitation', also receive substantial attention, suggesting a focus on bolstering the foundational elements that underpin economic growth and public health. Notably, less represented are sectors like 'Tourism' and 'Fishing', which may imply a current strategic shift or perhaps a maturity that requires less developmental intervention. The graph offers a visual representation of Mexico's developmental priorities, with a clear tilt towards agriculture, infrastructure, and basic public services.

Again, similarly to India, as this is showing the number of projects it does not illustrate how much has been invested into each sector. Understanding how much has been invested into each sector will help to explain the US$26 billion spent on the MX Social Protection in Health Project which appeared in out Anomalies section. 


## Summary 
In this section we can see which sectors have the most most projects for each country. Though there are slight variations between Morocco, Mexico and India, they all have the most projects in the agricultrual sector. In our Anomalies section we see that the both Mexico and India have aid of over USD 20 billion in sectors which have far fewer projects. We speculate that these much larger investments are attributed to the centralised aspect of the investment, for instance, India's investments of over USD 42 billion (SSA III (29 bil) & Secondary Education Program ($12bil)) is in the Education sector which is centrally managed by the Government, whereas perhaps agricultural projects are more plentiful because they are less concentrated. This can also be seen in Mexico's MX Social Protection in Health project. 

Another thing to consider is donor investment preferences in different regions, for instance, in Russia we see donors investing heavily in 'General Environment Protection' and 'Government and Civil Society', which strongly contrasts with heavy investment in agricultural projects for Morocco, India and Mexico. This is also inline with differing development levels for each country and their developmental priorities. 


## Regression Analysis


Below we perform our regression analyses,


The original dataset presents the size of projects in local currency depending on the donor, so we have created a function that standardizes the currency to USD.

```{python}
#This will look at multiple linear regression to predict rating from project duration and project size
project_size_df = all_aid.dropna(subset=['projectsize_original']).copy()

def convert_to_usd(row):
    donor = row['donor']
    amount = row['projectsize_original']
    rates = {'AfricanDB': 1, 'AsianDB': 1_000_000, 'DFID': 1.35, 'GEF': 1_000_000, 'GFATM': 1, 'GiZ': 1_200,
             'IFAD': 1_000_000, 'JICA': 10_687, 'KfW': 1.2, 'WB': 1}
    return rates[donor] * amount

# Apply the modified function to create a new column
project_size_df['project_size_USD_calculated'] = project_size_df.apply(convert_to_usd, axis=1)
```

```{python}
# Perform linear regression using statsmodels
import statsmodels.formula.api as smf
model = smf.ols('six_overall_rating ~ project_size_USD_calculated', data=project_size_df)
results = model.fit()

# Print out the summary of the regression
print(results.summary())

project_size_df['predicted_rating'] = results.fittedvalues

# Plotting
plt.figure(figsize=(10, 6))
plt.scatter(project_size_df['project_size_USD_calculated'].values, project_size_df['six_overall_rating'].values, alpha=0.5, label='Actual Values')
plt.plot(project_size_df['project_size_USD_calculated'].values, project_size_df['predicted_rating'].values, color='red', label='Regression Line')
plt.title('Linear Regression: Project Size (USD) vs Project Rating \n b = 1.976e-11 \n c = 4.235')
plt.xlabel('Project Size (USD)')
plt.ylabel('Project Rating')
plt.legend()
plt.grid(True)
plt.show()
```

Here we have created a linear regression to see if we can predict project rating from project size. Logically we would expect larger projects to have higher ratings because more resources were expended to improve the quality of the output. However, the results were disappointing, as the b value showed only a very small positive relationship, while the r^2 value is 0, which means that it is not a good predictor of the rating.

```{python}
#How many values for project_duration are negative and why?
project_size_df[project_size_df['project_duration'] < 0][['completion_date','start_date']]

#How many values for project_duration are between 0 and 10
project_size_df[(project_size_df['project_duration'] > 0) & (project_size_df['project_duration'] < 180)]

#DF to look at only projects longer than 6 months
duration_df = project_size_df[project_size_df['project_duration'] > 180]

duration_df
```

```{python}
#This plots three variables: Size, Rating, and Duration
def basic_3D_scatter():
    fig = plt.figure(figsize = (8, 8))
    ax = fig.add_subplot(projection='3d')
    #project size, rating, duration, and x
    ax.scatter(duration_df['project_size_USD_calculated'].values, duration_df['six_overall_rating'].values, duration_df['project_duration'].values)
    ax.set_xlabel('Size (USD)')
    ax.set_ylabel('Project Rating')
    ax.set_zlabel('Duration (Days)')
    ax.zaxis.labelpad=-3
    plt.show()

basic_3D_scatter()
```

```{python}
# Improved version of the 3D scatterplot function
def improved_3D_scatter():
    fig = plt.figure(figsize=(10, 8))
    ax = fig.add_subplot(111, projection='3d')
    
    # Scatter plot with increased point size and transparency for better visibility
    scatter = ax.scatter(duration_df['project_size_USD_calculated'],
                         duration_df['project_duration'],
                         duration_df['six_overall_rating'],
                         c=duration_df['six_overall_rating'],  # Color by duration
                         cmap='viridis',  # Color map
                         edgecolor='k',  # Edge color of the markers
                         s=50,  # Size of the markers
                         alpha=0.4)  # Transparency of the markers
    
    # Labels with padding for clarity
    ax.set_xlabel('Size (USD)', labelpad=15)
    ax.set_ylabel('Duration (Days)', labelpad=15)
    ax.set_zlabel('Rating', labelpad=15)
    
    # Title with increased font size
    ax.set_title('3D Scatter Plot of Project Metrics', pad=10)
    
    # Adding a color bar to indicate the scale of 'duration'
    cbar = plt.colorbar(scatter, shrink=0.5, aspect=10)
    cbar.set_label('Rating')
    
    # Customizing the grid and pane colors for better aesthetics
    ax.xaxis.pane.fill = False
    ax.yaxis.pane.fill = False
    ax.zaxis.pane.fill = False
    ax.grid(False)
    
    plt.show()

# Call the improved scatterplot function
improved_3D_scatter()

```

Here we are visualizing the relationship between three variables: project size in USD (Size [USD]), project duration in days (Duration [Days]), and a project rating on a scale from 1 to 6 (Rating). The x-axis represents the project size on a logarithmic scale, as indicated by the notation "1e10", with a range up to 10 billion USD or more. The y-axis represents project duration, and the z-axis represents the project rating.

The points in the scatter plot are color-coded according to the project rating, with this color scheme provided in the legend on the right side of the graph. Warmer colors (yellow) represent higher ratings, while cooler colors (purple) represent lower ratings.

From the distribution of the points, we can observe that there isn't a clear, singular trend between the size and duration of the projects with the ratings. However there appears to be some clustering of points, with denser areas of the graph suggesting common project sizes and durations. For instance, a high concentration of projects in the mid-range size (approximately 0.5 to 1.5 on the x-axis) seem to have a broad range of durations but generally receive mid to high ratings (3 to 5). There are outliers, of course, which deviate from these clusters.

The nature of the plot suggests that while there might be a relationship between the size and duration of a project and its rating, the relationship is not simple and likely influenced by other factors. There's also a hint that larger and longer projects do not necessarily correlate with higher ratings, as seen by the spread of colors across all sizes and durations.

```{python}
formula = 'project_size_USD_calculated ~ project_duration'

# Fit the model
multiple_model = smf.ols(formula, data=duration_df).fit()

# Print out the summary of the regression model
model_summary = multiple_model.summary()
model_summary
```

Here we aim to see if project duration, for projects lasting longer than 6 months can predict the rating.Again, the r^2 value is zero, which suggests not a good fit. This could be an issue with the model fitting the data, or poor data quality. It is rather unusual that the r^2 is 0, so this would warrent further analysis.

```{python}
formula = 'six_overall_rating ~ project_size_USD_calculated + project_duration'

# Fit the model
multiple_model = smf.ols(formula, data=duration_df).fit()

# Print out the summary of the regression model
model_summary = multiple_model.summary()
model_summary
```

We have performed another linear regression, this time with multiple predictors to see if both project size and duration together have a different impact on rating.

```{python}
#This scatter only contains values for project_duration longer than 180 days
plt.scatter(duration_df['project_duration'], duration_df['project_size_USD_calculated'])
```

```{python}

# Impact Analysis


We then wanted to look specifically at impact ratings. We began by exploring the impact ratings of projects funded by GiZ. Because of its relatively small number of projects, this would make our analysis easier. We did plan on expanding the scope of this analysis to include other donors, but due to time limitations we weren't able to follow through with this plan. 


According to the pdf, the impact rating includes the positive and negative changes produced by a development intervention, directly or indirectly, intended or unintended. This involves the main impacts and effects resulting from the activity on the local social, economic, environmental and
other development indicators. The examination should be concerned with both intended and unintended results and must also include the positive and negative impact of external factors, such as changes in terms of trade and financial conditions.
When evaluating the impact of a programme or a project, it is useful to consider the following questions: <br />
• What has happened as a result of the programme or project? <br />
• What real difference has the activity made to the beneficiaries? <br />
• How many people have been affected? <br />
